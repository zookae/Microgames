Welcome to Cabbage Quest!
In this game, you'll be working with another partner to decide the best location to purchase certain items.
Here's how it works!
You and your partner each have a location! We'll give you a set of items!
Assign which location to buy each item by clicking the correct location. If none of the items match the location, don't click on them.
Also, you'll get bonus points if you and your partner agree!
The timer at the bottom lets you know how much time you have left to decide.
Ready? Let's have a quick practice round!
