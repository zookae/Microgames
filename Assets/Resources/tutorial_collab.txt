Welcome to Cabbage Quest!
In this game, you'll be working with a partner to pick the best location to buy items.
Here's how it works. 
You and your partner each have a location. Your location is listed in the upper-left corner.
We lay out some items that you can buy, along with their locations.
Assign each item to a location by clicking the label. If you can't buy the item at any of the locations, don't click on any.
You get 10 points for picking the right location for an item.
You get an additional 10 bonus points if you and your partner agree on the same location! Nothing happens if you both choose different locations.
The timer at the bottom lets you know how much time until the end of the round.
Ready? Let's have a quick practice round!
